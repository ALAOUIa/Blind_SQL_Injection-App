### Blind SQL Injection - Dockerized

This project provides a Dockerized environment to simulate and test **Blind SQL Injection** attacks in a secure and isolated setup. 
The goal is to help users understand the mechanics of this attack, how it differs from traditional SQL Injection, and how to experiment with it using practical examples.

### What is Blind SQL Injection?

#### Difference Between SQL Injection and Blind SQL Injection

**SQL Injection** allows attackers to directly view the results of their malicious queries, such as database errors or data displayed on the webpage. It is fast and straightforward since the output is immediately visible.

**Blind SQL Injection**, however, does not show direct results. Instead, attackers infer information by observing the applicationâ€™s behavior (e.g., response times or changes in output). It is slower and more complex but can still extract sensitive data with persistence.
